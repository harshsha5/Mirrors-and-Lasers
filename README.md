# Mirrors-and-Lasers


The problem has been solved in python and the code can be obtained in the mirrors.py file.

Assumptions:
1) Arrange (x,y) Lexicographically implies, finding the least x and then the least y
2) We can only add mirrors to cells which don't already have a mirror present in them. Although this can be easily altered to extend mirror addition cases.

Notes: 
1) The code has been written in accordance with the input and output mentioned in the question file. However, other alternate input methods can be used too. One of them has been written in the code but commented.
